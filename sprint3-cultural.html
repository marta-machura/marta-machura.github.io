            <h1 class="hometitle">Emotional Intelligence</h1>
            <h2 class="subtitle">Sprint 3</h2>
            <h3 class="blogdate">27/4/2020</h3>
            <p class="entry">Emotional intelligence, in a nutshell, is the ability to read someone else’s behaviour as well as your own emotions and act appropriately. People with a high EQ (Emotional Quotient) are able to adapt quickly to new situations, can read group dynamics well, and therefore take actions that suit the situation. Having a high EQ is vital for people in, e.g., leadership positions, as they’re required to know their teams well in order to be successful and happy. It is complementing people’s IQ and is learned, to a substantial proportion.<br><br>

                Where the IQ measures a person’s (natural) ability to think logically and analytically, demonstrate spatial and visual processing as well as test one’s memory, the EQ consists of a person’s abilities to identify own as well as others’ emotions and also understand them. 
                EQ is just as important as IQ, as, with developing research, it is nowadays acknowledged that intelligence as such is multi-faceted, and not a static construct. 
                Emotional intelligence in particular is something that can be trained and developed.<br><br>
                
                In a professional context, a high level of emotional intelligence is beneficial, especially when it comes to either leading or working in teams, as well as any career that involves focussing on another person’s needs, like teaching, practicing medicine and rehabilitation, working in trades, and so on.<br><br>
                
                I can tell from my own professional experience that someone who is open, easy to communicate with and who doesn’t take things personally is so much easier to work with, than a highly intellectually intelligent person who ignores cues and messages being brought across to them. No one prefers to have the latter one on their team. It makes the work processes tedious and exhausting, as brilliant as their minds may be. I’ve seen it happen that a company would rather let such a person go than to keep them on. A well-functioning team is so much more productive than a team made up of clever, but cold individuals!
