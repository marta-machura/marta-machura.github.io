       <p>Hey everyone, I’m Marta! Born in Poland, raised in Germany, having had some uni life in Austria for a couple of years, I came to Wellington 10 years ago. I now live in Korokoro/Lower Hutt with my husband and our two cats.<br> Thinking about my values and identity reminded me of all the work I still need to put in to become what I think my values are and to sync up my ideal identity with who I currently am. Whoa! Self-reflection time (check out more in my Cultural Blog section)! It’s exciting to think of myself as a project in progress - tweaking my mindset, habits, outlooks, self-care… Am I thinking like a programmer yet? Haha!<br>
        I decided to join Dev Academy for several reasons. For the past 5 years, I was working as a manual tester for a website. But in a relatively non-techy and increasingly repetitive/boring way. Being a creative person, I tried to balance this mundaneness out with outside-of-work activities that I’m passionate about: dance, crafts, making music - but I never allowed myself to delve deeper into 'the techiness'. Though it had always been on my periphery (e.g. through paying for a Codecademy subscription, haha!). Whenever my then-workmate and ex-EDA-teacher Harrison showed me the details of a bug I had discovered, and how he fixed it, it intrigued me how I could potentially become the creator of features and bugs (haha), and also fix them myself! After quitting my job and some months of soul-searching (to tech or not to tech?), I decided to return to that idea, even though I always thought to myself that ‘I’m not techy enough’ or ‘I am not logical/analytical enough’ - I do, however, believe in neuroplasticity and practice, practice, practice! Excited to meet you all in person at Bootcamp (Covid-19 permitting)!
