            <p class="entry">In the long run, I’d love to combine my ‘natural’ skills with my newly-acquired ones. As I’ve already mentioned in my other blog post, one of my most important values is being there for and with a community, so I’d hopefully share my new skills with a company or an organisation that I personally care for. I’m still open as to in what form this would be - I have experience and skills in a couple of areas, but would love to just stick to one for a while, to hone it and finally leave my ‘Master on None’ label behind for good (though my personality type just naturally gravitates to trying out several things).<br><br>

                This brings me to the topic of my strengths and limitations, as they partially lie in areas of my personality. I’m curious about a lot of things, I can get excited and passionate about a lot of new concepts, topics, hobbies, but then struggle to juggle them all in a way to be able to follow each one of them consistently. Of course, that’s impossible (unless we clone ourselves or double the speed with which we do and process things), so the next sensible step usually would be to set priorities and focus on just one or two things at a time. And that is another work-in-progress-area of mine. I hate to be pinned down to one thing, seemingly not being able to keep any other options open. I have also seen how far this took me in life, whenever I had a ‘big’ goal, and I am very aware of this pattern to not get in the way of the potential of my EDA journey.<br><br> 
                
                Sprints 1 and 2 already were very good lessons for me, especially in terms of prioritisation and time management. In both sprints, I let my ‘weaknesses’ take over a bit (one is being sidetracked by non-vital details of my blog structure, the other is sacrificing half a day to do an assignment for an external client). 
                I’ve applied some strategies for a smooth and non-distracted way of progressing through the programme - first of all, the Toggl app works really well for me, as I like being able to look back at the end of the day and see all my productive hours accumulated. I’ve also resorted to simple, but nutritious food to keep a good focus and not to spend too long in the kitchen (I kinda do a mix between food-prepping and eating oats for a quick meal).<br><br>
                
                One of my values is to not let other people down - therefore, I have no issues working in teams, delivering what they need on time (to my best abilities). I have a bit of practice thanks to my professional background having worked as a software tester - so I know that communication is key. It’s always better to share an opinion or an observation than to keep it to yourself. I’ll therefore try my best to be as clear, honest and kind in all my communications with everyone. We all want to achieve similar things, so I am confident that our cohort will get through boot camp as a solid unit where people support each other (as far as they can).<br><br>
                
                My approach to getting help follows the pattern of:
                <br><br>
                
                a) Trying to do or understand something in a different way, then<br>
                b) Researching about it. If that doesn’t give me a solution, then<br>
                c) Ask the cohorts or the facilitator for help.<br><br>
                The tricky bits in asking for help lie in the timing. It’s important, we all don’t spend too much time fiddling around aimlessly or not getting the results we need when researching on our own. That’s where a lot of potential for lost time lies, and I’ve already lost some time on researching things that aren’t vital in that moment, according to the learning outcomes.<br><br> 
                
                I think the ultimate skill in this course is self-awareness and self-reflection. Even if we keep following a pattern of certain behaviour that we’d like to avoid - as long as we’re aware of it, we will ultimately profit heaps from ANY experience here at EDA and in our careers.
