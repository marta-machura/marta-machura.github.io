            <h3 class="blogdate">Neuroplasticity</h3>
            <p class="entry">I think, when talking about neuroplasticity, it’s important, first of all, to look at the term itself. The ‘plasticity of neurons’, implying our neuronal system, or parts of it, can be molded. In the same way, they can also be neglected and, as a consequence, either stay the same shape or even recede. Knowing these facts can be a game-changer in how people perceive their own learning journeys or the status quo of their abilities. If it becomes apparent that what we do not know now, or what we once used to know well can be restored and improved, a lot of excuses in life are no longer justified. To say you’re not ‘talented’ enough to be an artist? To think, ‘it’s just the way that learning languages is much harder for me than the average person’? In the light of knowing about the dynamic nature of our brain, these thoughts are outright wrong! I will comment on how to exactly shape new pathways inside our neuronal system further below.<br><br>
                As defined by neurologist Judy Willis, ‘neuroplasticity is [...] the selective organising of connections between neurons in our brains’. What does this mean? It means that, whenever we perform cognitive processes (that are not yet fully established, i.e. we’re at a learning curve), the neurons in question are grouped together to establish a (new) pathway (and yes, it can feel like a brain-stretch!). The more often this pathway gets used, the stronger it gets! This is where the saying ‘practice makes perfect’ comes into play. Studies have shown that regular, slightly challenging practice strengthens the neuronal groups and leads to solid connections - I think, anyone of us can relate to an experience where practice, while not always easy, led to improved results!<br><br>
                In my own journey at EDA, having never experienced learning a language like javaScript before, I could tell that my neurons had to be dusted off and pulled out of their comfy crevices at first, before they started sending ANY type of information back and forth! I had to repeat some of the basic concepts, as they just wouldn’t stick - but: every time I revised them, AND PRACTICED, the process got faster and faster. So, it’s pretty obvious to me that, in this journey in particular, coming from ‘the arts’, it will be more important than ever before for me to practice, practice, practice!<br><br>
                Another key element is to fully understand what is practiced. Though it may take longer, letting every concept sink in at least a bit before moving on saves a lot of revision effort later on. Learn from my mistakes, people!<br><br>
                One last point on neuroplasticity. While one can’t deny certain ‘predispositions’ (that were, however, most likely learned early on in life and childhood), everyone, absolutely everyone can improve heaps from their starting point! My arts teacher used to say ‘Drawing well/realistically is not accredited to talent. Drawing is like maths! The more you practice, the better you become at it!’ - I still thought I would rather not pursue the fine arts, as I thought I just don’t ‘have it in me’ - which brings me to the topic of…<br><br>

                <h3 class="blogdate">Growth Mindset</h3>
                <p class="entry">Growth mindset, as opposed to a fixed mindset, is a positive and open-minded attitude towards challenge, effort and learning, while being able to self-reflect. It can be the defining factor between development and stagnation, when it comes to one’s abilities. It is the realisation that all of us have malleable brains that can adjust to new concepts and skills, with practice. Often, that realisation paves the way to adapting a growth mindset for learning journeys.<br><br>
                    One thing that is important to note is that everyone has mixed mindsets, depending on the area of ability. There is no such thing as a 100% Growth-mindset-oriented person, nor is there a 100% fixed-mindset one I may, for example, totally embrace that, in my EDA journey, a substantial amount of effort and challenge is necessary for me to grow, but, at the same time, I may also think the opposite way when it comes to the crunch!<br><br>
                    What is surprising to me is that this change in attitude really makes the biggest difference in developing. Looking back at my life, I have to admit that some paths I could have pursued, I didn’t - because of my fixed mindset. Thinking of or observing others, who seem to be ‘just more gifted’ or ‘who get things faster than I do’ often gave me enough justification to give up, because there were always going to be enough people who are so much better at it than me. I then focused on something that I thought I just had a natural talent for, which was learning languages (at the time!). I now can most likely attest my affinity for learning languages to the fact that I was raised bilingually and had to learn German at Kindergarten, after we had moved to Germany from Poland. Maybe me ‘being talented’ wasn’t a thing, after all. This, however, should be such an eye-opener to everyone! Talent as such is a blurry concept, and often is used as an argument in a fixed mindset. Either you can or you can’t. But this should never be the final thought before moving on!<br><br>
                    Choosing EDA is me trying to prove myself wrong for all the times that I a) gave up or b) didn’t even start to begin with, because ‘I’m not cut out for that’. There will be a lot of challenges and learning curves in this journey, and this is why self-reflection is a very important component, as well. Questioning where I struggled and why, what my strategies were to overcome the difficulty, and so on, will all be building blocks to my personal and academic growth. It won’t happen overnight, I’m aware of that. Pro tip: awareness takes you halfway there already, as you will know the areas that need improvement or tweaking. I’ve put up the fixed vs growth mindset visualisation of characteristics (from the prep curriculum) on my noticeboard, so it’s always in my periphery whenever I’m struggling.<br><br>
