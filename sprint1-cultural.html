            <h2 class="subtitle">Sprint 1</h2>
            <h3 class="blogdate">24/4/2020</h3>
            <p class="entry">I am quite community-oriented in the way that I often want to help, but sometimes, this may come at the expense of my own allocated time or energy. However, I fully enjoy volunteering my time to various causes: I volunteer for a non-for-profit organisation creating performance workshops for young people with disabilities, I am a volunteer catler at the cat cafe in Petone and I regularly help out at communal clothes swaps, to reduce fast fashion and bring joy to people who cannot or don’t want to afford buying new clothes for themselves. One could sum it all up with my values deeply lying in community - and it’s reflected well in how I feel whenever I am at a social event or gathering. I usually leave with warm fuzzies and much happier than before.<br><br>
                I cannot come up with a concrete situation that involves ethics as such, but I am often conflicted, when it comes to dividing my time and energy among others and myself. I do want to help out as much as I can, and it’s almost always hard for me to say no to things - even if they are not viable and come at the expense of my time and wellbeing. I often feel guilty just being asked for a favour by someone whom I know I should deny this time - and often end up doing them the favour anyway. Even now, during Sprint 1, I was asked to do a badly-paid translation task for a company. And because I knew that I was the last person to have worked on their website translation, and felt that any other person would lose time getting into the context of things, I agreed to do the job (thank god, it only took a couple of hours, but still!). So much to learn from all of these experiences!<br><br>
                As humans, we grow up to be part of so many different cultures - the culture of your family traditions may be wildly different from the ones of the environment you encounter in your everyday life, outside your family circle. I can say for myself that I am incredibly fortunate and privileged to have grown up in a stable family, in a peaceful country and with a relatively open-minded culture, when it comes to self-expression. Therefore, it almost feels like my values could have gone in many directions, having that much freedom - the focal point for me lies in community and being there for each other. Going through tough times together is creating an energy that is very different from having accomplished things on your own. I guess another quality I value is being open-minded and humble - everyone’s story is different, and it’s often too easy to form an opinion based on a few facts. I’m guilty of that myself, but am trying to be aware of this trait.<br><br>
                In terms of identity, I’d like to think that I can shape myself towards whichever version of myself I’d like to be. At the core, I know my potential is there. It’s the clay which I can form to become a perfect shape. When I ask myself, who I am and what I want, the reality is a bit different. I’m often confused and unsure about the essence of ‘me’. There is still so much room to grow and I have so many ideas for my daily life that I can only say I enjoy this journey. And I have to be grateful to my immediate culture (my family, my friends, my husband and the country I live in).<br><br>
                 
                My strengths lie in compassion, connecting with people and being creative together (as well as alone) - in my career so far, I was always the connecting element inside and between teams. People would find it easy to come to me for help, and it’s always been easy for me to explain concepts or certain business rules to others, thanks to my background as a language teacher. Speaking of that, I’m quite patient and can paraphrase well to convey a complex message (I hope!). Another strength of mine is attention to detail - I admit, it’s the result of practice, but still - it’s great to know we can develop all kinds of skills if we only practice!<br><br>
                My limitations lie in me getting distracted and bored easily, I suppose. I am probably not the best fit for a job that is very repetitive. According to the 16 personalities test, I am a ‘Campaigner’ type, or ENFP-T. According to that personality profile, my weaknesses lie in having poor practical skills (yup!), overthinking things (yup!), being highly emotional (yup!) and get stressed easily (yup!) - Awareness of all of this, however, is a strength in itself, and I am going to use my time at EDA to grow through some of my limitations and learn from all the experiences we will have. I have already started to change some aspects of my routine to help my lack of practical skills, for example. I’m looking forward to all learning experiences, be it tech or core, that will shape us as a group and individually.<br><br>
                I’ve had to work in a team before where some members of the team had wildly different communication styles, and while these styles worked perfectly for them individually, it brought tension to the group when mixed. I was supposed to coordinate that team for a project we were working on. At first, I encouraged more frequent communication by posting often in our Slack channel. However, this was too subtle and did not give the necessary change in how the people in question communicated with each other. I didn’t want to force person A’s style upon person B, so in the end, we moved away from Slack altogether and did more detailed project catch-ups in person, where everyone got to share with the group where they’re at and what is blocking them - this way, things came to surface that person A and person B may not have been aware of before, and they became more lenient/forgiving with each others’ work, because they knew where the other person’s actions came from.
