            <h1 class="hometitle">Reflecting on Core Learning</h1>
            <h2 class="subtitle">Sprint 5</h2>
            <h3 class="blogdate">17/5/2020</h3>
            
                <h3 class="blogdate">What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3><br>
                <p class="entry">
                    First of all, I’ve learned that I won’t change my attitude towards problems or the way I deal with frustrating situations overnight. And that’s ok. It’s a progressive unlearning process - for the first time in my life, something that could make me feel absolutely blocked and, for lack of better words, stupid, was the same thing that would also bring me joy whenever things would go according to plan. That’s where my ego comes into play. I’ve had numerous occasions where I let my fixed mindset take a hold of me and would tell myself that I’m not smart enough for this. This would happen whenever I would deem the timeframe in which I was trying to understand a new concept to be too long. I also noticed that I am letting myself get impressed with these feelings of inferiority whenever I would ask the cohorts, a large group of people, for help. Assuming that there are many others out there who understood and completed something within a fraction of the duration it took me to solve a problem, intimidated me. I am also aware, however, that we’re all from different backgrounds and also put different amounts of time into this - have I been giving it my all 100% of the time and spent as much time as I possibly could on learning and revising? This is all a work in progress, but I am happy that there is consistent movement in the progress.<br><br>
                    Looking back at my other cultural blogs, I am proud to have had the reflective capacity that I have used to write these blogs. Whenever my ‘old’ self is surfacing, these are actually a good point to get grounded from. So, this is another thing I learned about myself. I have a somewhat wise side that I can refer to,if I’ve been smart enough to write those wise words down!
                </p><br><br>
                 
                 
                <h3 class="blogdate">What are the roles of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3><br>
                <p class="entry">All three components are the driver in succeeding with a project, a team or a career. If we don’t empathise, it will be hard for us to work as part of a team. If we’re not self-aware, it will be hard to improve on any areas that need improving. Our values should also align with what we ultimately do, as we will otherwise not be motivated to do a good job.</p><br>
                 
                <h3 class="blogdate">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3><br>
                <p class="entry">
                    Like I have mentioned further up, me reflecting on the week or on a topic inside a weekly blog post, and looking back at it, is like getting advice from a friend. The only thing is, I would not always tell myself these exact things in an immediate situation. But re-reading the blog posts solidifies my goals and my problem solving strategies.
                </p><br>
                <h3 class="blogdate">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3><br>
                <p class="entry">Whenever self-reflection would show me a side of me that I had thought was not ‘problematic’, but may be more serious than I had thought - that emotional learning curve can probably be described as challenging. Overall, however, I enjoyed the core learning a lot, and it reignited my joy for writing!</p><br>
                <h3 class="blogdate">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3><br>
                <p class="entry">You smart and clever people have probably also seen the consequences of trying to integrate a person who may be a brilliant developer but a bad communicator into a team. Or a straight-A CS graduate struggling to get invited to any interview or any second interviews. A lot of the code-teaching-resources out there completely bypass the topic of collaborating in a team and cultural fit, so it’s important that aspiring developers get a realistic outlook on what is needed in the field, especially when trying to get hired by a company whose structure is made up of teams.</p><br>
                <h3 class="blogdate">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3><br>
                <p class="entry">Absolutely not. In fact, the core learning has kept me from giving up whenever I had thought that I’ve hit the ultimate wall. Apart from the fact that it’s impossible to use 100% of our time completely focussed on programming, it’s a great primer for boot camp. I think, it will make a big difference, coming into boot camp, being not only self-aware, but also empathetic to others’ journeys and ready to help and be helped!<br><br>
